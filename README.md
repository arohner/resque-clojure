# resque-clojure

Resque (pronounced like "rescue") is a Redis-backed library for creating background jobs,
placing those jobs on multiple queues, and processing them later. It was originally developed
for the ruby language. https://github.com/defunkt/resque

Resque-clojure is a clojure-based implementation of the same protocol. It aims to be
fully interoperable with the original project.
